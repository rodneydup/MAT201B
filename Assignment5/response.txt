The video by Art of Code was one of the most accessible introductions to ray marching I've seen. I understood everything he said.

Running the ray marching example, it runs pretty well. I notice that the program slows down a lot as I expand thewindow though. This is probably because shaders are calculated per pixel and the pixel count grows a lot. Also notice my cpu usage report doesn't go up much even when my machine is really struggling, which makes sense since the GPU is doing all the work.

The glsl files are still mostly greek to me but I hope I'll get more familiar with the syntax soon. I'm also wondering why there are so many functions in fragment.glsl. I definitely didn't expect it to be 400 lines after watching the art of code example and seeing how "simple" ray marching can be.

Doing the book of shaders went well. It was useful to apply the concepts as I learned them using their editor.
