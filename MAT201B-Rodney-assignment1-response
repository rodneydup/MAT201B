Reading chapters 5, 6, and 7 of Marschner & Shirley, it was a bit dense but I got some of it. Some of the linear algebra was review since I spent a lot of time working with that kind of math last quarter in Yon's physics class.

Chapter 6 started out pretty basic but toward the end it got interesting. Affine transformations always get me.

Chapter 7 was cool, I hadn't put this much thought into how 3D constructions are rendered in 2d viewports until now. It was a little tough to follow at times but there was some good stuff in there.
